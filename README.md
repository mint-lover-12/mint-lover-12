## Hi there 👋

## What I enjoy:
### DRM - Digital Rights Management

This is better known as piracy preventation, I enjoy trying to protect programs from people trying to crack and leak them.

### Java

I originally started out with blockly, and then Python. However, I disliked the chaotic nature of Python. When I moved to Java, it felt a lot more controlable, and I prefered the structuring a lot more.

### Malware

I love malware analysis and creation. Obviously infecting peoples machines with malware is bad, I just enjoy seeing how Microsoft Defender has defended my PC from a RAT I built 9 months ago. 

### Cheats

I enjoy 'figuring out' things. I dont necessarily enjoy cheating per say, but I enjoy the creation of something to serve a purpose.
